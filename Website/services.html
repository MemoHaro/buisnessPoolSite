              <h3>Pool Plastering</h3>

              <h3>Pool Replastering</h3>
              <p>Exposure to excessive moisture, regular use, outdoor conditions, changes in temperature and general wear can take their toll on the appearance and structural integrity of a pool. With regular maintenance and prompt repairs, you can extend the life of the pool and ensure you don’t need to replace them often. Replastering the pool is an essential aspect of this maintenance.</p>

              <h3>Pool Tile Installation</h3>
              <p>Most pools are in-ground and made from concrete. This surface is porous and rough, and vulnerable to excessive moisture and harsh outdoor conditions. The concrete needs to be covered by plaster, or other such finishing materials or techniques to ensure the pool bottom surface is usable. Since most pools are finished with plaster and this material is installed and maintained submerged in water. The area above this material needs to be finished with tile and typically leaving a 6-inch area or may have raised bond beam for tile installation.</p>

              <h3>Pool Plumbing</h3>
              <p>An outdoor pool isn’t useful if it doesn’t have proper plumbing. The pipes bring in water to fill the pool, draw it away for filtration and cleaning, and perform similar tasks to ensure the pool water is fresh and ready for swimming. The pool plumbing system is relatively simple to understand but it is very difficult to install. You need professional installation to ensure it functions well at all times</p>
